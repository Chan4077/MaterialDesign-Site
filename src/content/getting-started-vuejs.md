# VueJS - Getting Started

## First Party

We need help making https://github.com/JamesCoyle/vue-icon fully featured. Once basic functionality is tested it will be published to NPM.

Use the [Getting Started React](/getting-started/react) as a basis for missing features.

## Third Parties

You can find a collection of the SVG icons as Single File Components packaged
as [vue-material-design-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-material-design-icons).
